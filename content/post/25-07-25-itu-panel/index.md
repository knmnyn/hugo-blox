Here was Min's opening statement.

<blockquote>
I was from a not well-to-do family but an open account left at an internet cafe allowed me access. GPT 7 raised me well, I learned with its guidance and became skilled and respected for commanding AI to better research from a multicultural perspective. I became a student tutor early and continued this into my university education. Sometimes AI gave me feedback sometimes not, but I understood that the "scaffold" was there to help challenge myself, to build myself and resolve; like level design in games — not quite out of reach but certainly a stretch. Now we have our own teaching feedback, our own loss function. My teacher manages me, and I wonder how different it is with me managing my students. I find social justice that being nice and communicating well still serves a good purpose because AI senses that such qualities are helpful in achieving its own goals. I feel a sense of purpose but also a sense that I may have been waylaid into this sense of purpose. Determinism is always at the back of my mind.
