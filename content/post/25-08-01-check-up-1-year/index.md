Our Crazy Ideas project, **CheckUp: Grounding Social Media on Healthcare with Science**, has made strong progress in advancing the dissemination of reliable health information on social media.

We introduced **HashView**, a benchmark dataset for predicting hashtag popularity, and developed BuzzProphet, a reasoning-augmented framework that combines insights from large language models with lightweight regressors. This research has been accepted at CIKM 2025, highlighting the novelty and relevance of our approach. The project has also contributed to capacity building by supporting one Research Assistant and mentoring two students, including one MComp graduate and one ongoing undergraduate FYP student.

Building on CheckUp's early findings, we have secured a S$ 100K Ministry of Education Tier 1 grant entitled "Automating Community Note Generation for Social Media Misinformation Governance". The groundwork laid by CheckUp demonstrated how LLMs can enhance the clarity and contextual relevance of social media content, directly informing the design of this new initiative. While CheckUp focuses on proactive communication of credible information, the Tier 1 project addresses the post-exposure stage of misinformation by developing real-time, AI-driven Community Notes as corrective tools. Together, these efforts form a complementary strategy for reducing the societal harms of health misinformation.
