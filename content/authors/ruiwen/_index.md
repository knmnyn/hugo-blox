Ruiwen is a first-year Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Min-Yen Kan and Prof. Soujanya Poria.  His research interest primarily lies on LLM reasoning and interactive AI agents. Previously, he was a student researcher supervised by Prof. Weinan Zhang in APEX Lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and he visited University of California, Santa Barbara and collaborated with Prof. William Wang in 2024.

He is working on utilizing reinforcement learning and developing test-time algorithmic frameworks to enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs, as well as analyzing and improving LLM strategic reasoning within multi-agent systems. He has also been interested in retrieval-augmented LLM agents, especially about how to extract useful state representations as queries and keys. Feel free to contact Ruiwen for discussions and potential collaborations!
