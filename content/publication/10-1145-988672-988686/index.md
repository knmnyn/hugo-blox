abstract: Breaking news often contains timely definitions and descriptions of current
  terms, organizations and personalities. We utilize such web sources to construct
  definitions for such terms. Previous work has identified definitions using hand-crafted
  rules or supervised learning that constructs rigid, hard text patterns. In contrast,
  we demonstrate a new approach that uses flexible, soft matching patterns to characterize
  definition sentences. Our soft patterns are able to effectively accommodate the
  diversity of definition sentence structure exhibited in news. We use pseudo-relevance
  feedback to automatically label sentences for use in soft pattern generation. The
  application of our unsupervised method significantly improves baseline systems on
  both the standardized TREC corpus as well as crawled online news articles by 27%
  and 30%, respectively, in terms of F measure. When applied to a state-of-art definition
  generation system recently fielded in the TREC 2003 definitional question answering
  task, it improves the performance by 14%.
