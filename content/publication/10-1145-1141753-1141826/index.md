abstract: In scholarly digital libraries, author disambiguation is an important task
  that attributes a scholarly work with specific authors. This is critical when individuals
  share the same name. We present an approach to this task that analyzes the results
  of automatically-crafted web searches. A key observation is that pages from rare
  web sites are stronger source of evidence than pages from common web sites, which
  we model as Inverse Host Frequency (IHF). Our system is able to achieve an average
  accuracy of 0.836.
