abstract: Many applications which use web data extract information from a limited
  number of regions on a web page. As such, web page division into blocks and the
  subsequent block classification have become a preprocessing step. We introduce PARCELS,
  an open-source, co-trained approach that performs classification based on separate
  stylistic and lexical views of the web page. Unlike previous work, PARCELS performs
  classification on fine-grained blocks. In addition to table-based layout, the system
  handles real-world pages which feature layout based on divisions and spans as well
  as stylistic inference for pages using cascaded style sheets. Our evaluation shows
  that the co-training process results in a reduction of 28.5% in error rate over
  a single-view classifier and that our approach is comparable to other state-of-the-art
  systems.
