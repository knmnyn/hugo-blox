abstract: We introduce a general, interest-aware topic model (IATM), in which known
  higher-level interests on topics expressed by each user can be modeled. We then
  specialize the IATM for use in consumer health forum thread recommendation by equating
  each user's self-reported medical conditions as interests and topics as symptoms
  of treatments for recommendation. The IATM additionally models the implicit interests
  embodied by users' textual descriptions in their profiles. To further enhance the
  personalized nature of the recommendations, we introduce jointly normalized collaborative
  topic regression (JNCTR) which captures how users interact with the various symptoms
  belonging to the same clinical condition. In our experiments on two real-world consumer
  health forums, our proposed model significantly outperforms competitive state-of-the-art
  baselines by over 10% in recall. Importantly, we show that our IATM+JNCTR pipeline
  also imbues the recommendation process with added transparency, allowing a recommendation
  system to justify its recommendation with respect to each user's interest in certain
  health conditions.
