abstract: 'We introduce NPIC, an image classification system that focuses on synthetic
  (e.g., non-photographic) images. We use class-specific keywords in an image search
  engine to create a noisily labeled training corpus of images for each class. NPIC
  then extracts both content-based image retrieval (CBIR) features and metadata-based
  textual features for each image for machine learning. We evaluate this approach
  on three different granularities: 1) natural vs. synthetic, 2) map vs. figure vs.
  icon vs. cartoon vs. artwork 3) and further subclasses of the map and figure classes.
  The NPIC framework achieves solid performance (99%, 97% and 85% in cross validation,
  respectively). We find that visual features provide a significant boost in performance,
  and that textual and visual features vary in usefulness at the different levels
  of granularities of classification.'
