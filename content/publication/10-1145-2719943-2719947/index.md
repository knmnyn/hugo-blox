abstract: Finding relevant scholarly papers is an important task for researchers.
  Such a literature search involves identifying drawbacks in existing works and proposing
  new approaches that address them. However, the growing number of scientific published
  papers results in information overload even for simple searches, such that researchers
  have difficulty in finding papers relevant to their interests. Recommendation systems
  can help address this problem to find relevant papers efficiently. In this article,
  we summarize our work on scholarly paper recommendation from both relevance and
  serendipitous perspectives. Experimental results on a publicly-available scholarly
  paper recommendation dataset show that our proposed approaches provides promising
  recommendations for researchers, outperforming the state-of-the-art with statistical
  significance.
