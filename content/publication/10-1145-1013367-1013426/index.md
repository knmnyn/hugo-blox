abstract: Uniform resource locators (URLs), which mark the address of a resource on
  the World Wide Web, are often human-readable and can hint at the category of the
  resource. This paper explores the use of URLs for webpage categorization via a two-phase
  pipeline of word segmentation/expansion and classification. We quantify its performance
  against document-based methods, which require the retrieval of the source document.
