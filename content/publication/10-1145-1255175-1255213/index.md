abstract: Traditionally, record linkage algorithms have played an important role in
  maintaining digital libraries - i.e., identifying matching citations or authors
  for consolidation in updating or integrating digital libraries. As such, a variety
  of record linkage algorithms have been developed and deployed successfully. Often,
  however, existing solutions have a set of parameters whose values are set by human
  experts off-lineand are fixed during the execution. Since finding the ideal values
  of such parameters is not straightforward, or no such single ideal value even exists,
  the applicability of existing solutions to new scenarios or domains is greatly hampered.
  To remedy this problem, we argue that one can achieve significant improvement by
  adaptively and dynamically changing such parameters of record linkage algorithms.
  To validate our hypothesis, we take a classical record linkage algorithm, the sorted
  neighborhood method (SNM), and demonstrate how we can achieve improved accuracy
  and performance by adaptively changing its fixed sliding window size. Our claim
  is analytically and empirically validated using both real and synthetic data sets
  of digital libraries and other domains.
