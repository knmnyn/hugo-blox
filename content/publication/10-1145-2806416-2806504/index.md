abstract: Most existing collaborative filtering techniques have focused on modeling
  the binary relation of users to items by extracting from user ratings. Aside from
  users' ratings, their affiliated reviews often provide the rationale for their ratings
  and identify what aspects of the item they cared most about. We explore the rich
  evidence source of aspects in user reviews to improve top-N recommendation. By extracting
  aspects (i.e., the specific properties of items) from textual reviews, we enrich
  the user--item binary relation to a user--item--aspect ternary relation. We model
  the ternary relation as a heterogeneous tripartite graph, casting the recommendation
  task as one of vertex ranking. We devise a generic algorithm for ranking on tripartite
  graphs -- TriRank -- and specialize it for personalized recommendation. Experiments
  on two public review datasets show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods. Most importantly, TriRank endows the recommender system with a higher degree
  of explainability and transparency by modeling aspects in reviews. It allows users
  to interact with the system through their aspect preferences, assisting users in
  making informed decisions.
