abstract: This paper describes the organization and results of the automatic keyphrase
  extraction task held at the Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2010 (SemEval-2010).
  The keyphrase extraction task was specifically geared towards scientific articles.
  Systems were automatically evaluated by matching their extracted keyphrases against
  those assigned by the authors as well as the readers to the same documents. We outline
  the task, present the overall ranking of the submitted systems, and discuss the
  improvements to the state-of-the-art in keyphrase extraction.
