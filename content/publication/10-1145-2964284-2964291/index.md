abstract: "While efforts have been made on bridging the semantic gap in image understanding,
  the in situ understanding of social media images is arguably more important but
  has had less progress. In this work, we enrich the representation of images in image
  tweets by considering their social context. We argue that in the microblog context,
  traditional image features, e.g., low-level SIFT or high-level detected objects,
  are far from adequate in interpreting the necessary semantics latent in image tweets.
  To bridge this gap, we move from the images' pixels to their context and propose
  a context-aware image bf tweet modelling (CITING) framework to mine and fuse contextual
  text to model such social media images' semantics. We start with tweet's intrinsic
  contexts, namely, 1) text within the image itself and 2) its accompanying text;
  and then we turn to the extrinsic contexts: 3) the external web page linked to by
  the tweet's embedded URL, and 4) the Web as a whole. These contexts can be leveraged
  to benefit many fundamental applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness our framework,
  we focus on the task of personalized image tweet recommendation, developing a feature-aware
  matrix factorization framework that encodes the contexts as a part of user interest
  modelling. Extensive experiments on a large Twitter dataset show that our proposed
  method significantly improves performance. Finally, to spur future studies, we have
  released both the code of our recommendation model and our image tweet dataset."
