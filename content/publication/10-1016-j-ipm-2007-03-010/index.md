abstract: We argue that the quality of a summary can be evaluated based on how many
  concepts in the original document(s) that can be preserved after summarization.
  Here, a concept refers to an abstract or concrete entity or its action often expressed
  by diverse terms in text. Summary generation can thus be considered as an optimization
  problem of selecting a set of sentences with minimal answer loss. In this paper,
  we propose a document concept lattice that indexes the hierarchy of local topics
  tied to a set of frequent concepts and the corresponding sentences containing these
  topics. The local topics will specify the promising sub-spaces related to the selected
  concepts and sentences. Based on this lattice, the summary is an optimized selection
  of a set of distinct and salient local topics that lead to maximal coverage of concepts
  with the given number of sentences. Our summarizer based on the concept lattice
  has demonstrated competitive performance in Document Understanding Conference 2005
  and 2006 evaluations as well as follow-on tests.
