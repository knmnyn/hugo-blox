abstract: 'Existing solutions to task-oriented dialogue systems follow pipeline designs
  which introduces architectural complexity and fragility. We propose a novel, holistic,
  extendable framework based on a single sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model which
  can be optimized with supervised or reinforcement learning. A key contribution is
  that we design text spans named belief spans to track dialogue believes, allowing
  task-oriented dialogue systems to be modeled in a seq2seq way. Based on this, we
  propose a simplistic Two Stage CopyNet instantiation which emonstrates good scalability:
  significantly reducing model complexity in terms of number of parameters and training
  time by a magnitude. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pipeline-based
  methods on large datasets and retains a satisfactory entity match rate on out-of-vocabulary
  (OOV) cases where pipeline-designed competitors totally fail.'
