abstract: Neural models for automated fact verification have achieved promising results
  thanks to the availability of large, human-annotated datasets. However, for each
  new domain that requires fact verification, creating a dataset by manually writing
  claims and linking them to their supporting evidence is expensive. We develop QACG,
  a framework for training a robust fact verification model by using automatically
  generated claims that can be supported, refuted, or unverifiable from evidence from
  Wikipedia. QACG generates question-answer pairs from the evidence and then converts
  them into different types of claims. Experiments on the FEVER dataset show that
  our QACG framework significantly reduces the demand for human-annotated training
  data. In a zero-shot scenario, QACG improves a RoBERTa model′s F1 from 50% to 77%,
  equivalent in performance to 2K+ manually-curated examples. Our QACG code is publicly
  available.
