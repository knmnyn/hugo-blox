abstract: As e-learning becomes increasingly popular in learning, it is necessary
  to evaluate students' perceptions on e-learning systems to enhance the quality of
  the systems. This paper describes a survey on a group of 451 students from a local
  university using edveNTUre, a proprietary e-learning system powered by Blackboard.
  Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study aimed to investigate the
  factors leading to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and behavioural intention
  to use the e-learning system. This paper concludes with a discussion on the interaction
  design of e-learning systems from students' perspectives.
