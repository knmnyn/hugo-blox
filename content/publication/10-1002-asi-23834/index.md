abstract: Big Science and cross-disciplinary collaborations have reshaped the intellectual
  structure of research areas. A number of works have tried to uncover this hidden
  intellectual structure by analyzing citation contexts. However, none of them analyzed
  by document logical structures such as sections. The two major goals of this study
  are to find characteristics of authors who are highly cited section-wise and to
  identify the differences in section-wise author networks. This study uses 29,158
  of research articles culled from the ACL Anthology, which hosts articles on computational
  linguistics and natural language processing. We find that the distribution of citations
  across sections is skewed and that a different set of highly cited authors share
  distinct academic characteristics, according to their citation locations. Furthermore,
  the author networks based on citation context similarity reveal that the intellectual
  structure of a domain differs across different sections.
