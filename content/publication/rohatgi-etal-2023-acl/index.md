abstract: 'We present ACL OCL, a scholarly corpus derived from the ACL Anthology to
  assist Open scientific research in the Computational Linguistics domain. Integrating
  and enhancing the previous versions of the ACL Anthology, the ACL OCL contributes
  metadata, PDF files, citation graphs and additional structured full texts with sections,
  figures, and links to a large knowledge resource (Semantic Scholar). The ACL OCL
  spans seven decades, containing 73K papers, alongside 210K figures. We spotlight
  how ACL OCL applies to observe trends in computational linguistics. By detecting
  paper topics with a supervised neural model, we note that interest in ``Syntax:
  Tagging, Chunking and Parsing″ is waning and ``Natural Language Generation″ is resurging.
  Our dataset is available from HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/datasets/WINGNUS/ACL-OCL).'
