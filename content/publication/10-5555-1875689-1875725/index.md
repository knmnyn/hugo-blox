abstract: We investigate the automatic harvesting of research paper metadata from
  recent scholarly events. Our system, Kairos, combines a focused crawler and an information
  extraction engine, to convert a list of conference websites into a index filled
  with fields of metadata that correspond to individual papers. Using event date metadata
  extracted from the conference website, Kairos proactively harvests metadata about
  the individual papers soon after they are made public. We use a Maximum Entropy
  classifier to classify uniform resource locators (URLs) as scientific conference
  websites and use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract individual paper metadata
  from such websites. Experiments show an acceptable measure of classification accuracy
  of over 95% for each of the two components.
