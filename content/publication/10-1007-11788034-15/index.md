abstract: Recent research in video retrieval has focused on automated, high-level
  feature indexing on shots or frames. One important application of such indexing
  is to support precise video retrieval. We report on extensions of this semantic
  indexing on news video retrieval. First, we utilize extensive query analysis to
  relate various high-level features and query terms by matching the textual description
  and context in a time-dependent manner. Second, we introduce a framework to effectively
  fuse the relation weights with the detectors' confidence scores. This results in
  individual high level features that are weighted on a per-query basis. Tests on
  the TRECVID 2005 dataset show that the above two enhancements yield significant
  improvement in performance over a corresponding state-of-the-art video retrieval
  baseline.
