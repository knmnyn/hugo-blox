abstract: Users participate in online discussion forums to learn from others and share
  their knowledge with the community. They often start a thread with a question or
  by sharing their new findings on a certain topic. We find that, unlike Community
  Question Answering, where questions are mostly factoid based, the threads in a forum
  are often open-ended (e.g., asking for recommendations from others) without a single
  correct answer. In this paper, we address the task of identifying helpful posts
  in a forum thread to help users comprehend long running discussion threads, which
  often contain repetitive or irrelevant posts. We propose a recurrent neural network
  based architecture to model (i) the relevance of a post regarding the original post
  starting the thread and (ii) the novelty it brings to the discussion, compared to
  the previous posts in the thread. Experimental results on different types of online
  forum datasets show that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
  neural network models for text classification.
