abstract: Training on only perfect Standard English corpora predisposes pre-trained
  neural networks to discriminate against minorities from non-standard linguistic
  backgrounds (e.g., African American Vernacular English, Colloquial Singapore English,
  etc.). We perturb the inflectional morphology of words to craft plausible and semantically
  similar adversarial examples that expose these biases in popular NLP models, e.g.,
  BERT and Transformer, and show that adversarially fine-tuning them for a single
  epoch significantly improves robustness without sacrificing performance on clean
  data.
