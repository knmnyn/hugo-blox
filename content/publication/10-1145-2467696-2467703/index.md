abstract: 'We introduce Enlil, an information extraction system that discovers the
  institutional affiliations of authors in scholarly papers. Enlil consists of two
  steps: one that first identifies authors and affiliations using a conditional random
  field; and a second support vector machine that connects authors to their affiliations.
  We benchmark Enlil in three separate experiments drawn from three different sources:
  the ACL Anthology Corpus, the ACM Digital Library, and a set of cross-disciplinary
  scientific journal articles acquired by querying Google Scholar. Against a state-of-the-art
  production baseline, Enlil reports a statistically significant improvement in F_1
  of nearly 10% (p << 0.01). In the case of multidisciplinary articles from Google
  Scholar, Enlil is benchmarked over both clean input (F_1 > 90%) and automatically-acquired
  input (F_1 > 80%).We have deployed Enlil in a case study involving Asian genomics
  research publication patterns to understand how government sponsored collaborative
  links evolve. Enlil has enabled our team to construct and validate new metrics to
  quantify the facilitation of research as opposed to direct publication.'
