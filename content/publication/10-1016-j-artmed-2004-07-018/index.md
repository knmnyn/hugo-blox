abstract: 'Objective:: We present the summarization system in the PErsonalized Retrieval
  and Summarization of Images, Video and Language (PERSIVAL) medical digital library.
  Although we discuss the context of our summarization research within the PERSIVAL
  platform, the primary focus of this article is on strategies to define and generate
  customized summaries. Methods and material:: Our summarizer employs a unified user
  model to create a tailored summary of relevant documents for either a physician
  or lay person. The approach takes advantage of regularities in medical literature
  text structure and content to fulfill identified user needs. Results:: The resulting
  summaries combine both machine-generated text and extracted text that comes from
  multiple input documents. Customization includes both group-based modeling for two
  classes of users, physician and lay person, and individually driven models based
  on a patient record. Conclusions:: Our research shows that customization is feasible
  in a medical digital library.'
