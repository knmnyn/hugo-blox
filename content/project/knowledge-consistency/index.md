title: "M^3Check: A Demonstration System for Multilingual Multi-clue Multi-Hop Fact-Checking"

summary: Fact-checking real-world claims often requires complex, multi-step reasoning due to the absence of direct evidence to support or refute them. M^3Check guides the model's reasoning process by constructing a structured, supervised, and verified chain of clues for verifying a claim, fostering a transparent, explainable, and user-friendly fact-checking process for multiple languages.

Imagine that, while we cannot simply Google a complex claim, we can still find some relevant clues to help us. The question is,  how can we use these clues to verify the input claim?  M^3Check is a RAG model that follows three major steps: 1) break down the claim into clues,  2) verify each clue based on articles, and 3) conclude, check, and reason the claim based on a structured, supervised, and verified chain of clues. This project leverages findings from multiple projects, offering a good example of how research outcomes can be applied to address a real-world problem.
